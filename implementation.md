### Implementation Plan
- [x] Set up a cloud infrastructure (2 NVIDIA Tesla P100 w/ 32 GB VRAM) on Oracle Cloud
- [x] Initialize base repo _snark-challenge-prover-reference_
- [ ] Add comments to the codebase to understand its construction and the MSM/FFT algorithm implementation
- [ ] Make the neccessary optimizations as in the _gpu-groth16-prover-3x_ codebase
