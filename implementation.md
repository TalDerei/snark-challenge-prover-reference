### Implementation Plan
- [x] Set up a cloud infrastructure (2 NVIDIA Tesla P100 w/ 32 GB VRAM) on Oracle Cloud
- [x] Initialize base repo _snark-challenge-prover-reference_
- [ ] Work on tutorials and coda workshop: https://coinlist.co/build/coda/pages/prover#starter-code
    - [x] Starter Code: Field Arithmetic
    - [ ] Stage 1: Quadratic Extension Arithmetic
    - [ ] Stage 2: Cubic Extension Arithmetic
    - [ ] Stage 3: Curve Operations
- [ ] Add general comments to the codebase to understand the general flows for the C++ prover
- [ ] Add comments to the codebase to understand its wrappers implemented in the cuda GPU prover
- [ ] Need to understand the Fast Fourier Transform (FFTs) algorithm implementation
- [ ] Need to understand the Mutli-Scalar Multiplication (MSM) algorithm implementation
